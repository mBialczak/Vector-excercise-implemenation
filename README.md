# Vector-excercise-implemenation

This is just a simplified implemenation of Vector<T> class created and develop during my C++ training on templates.
It should mimic std::vector<T> functionality with obvious simplifications and some possible different behaviour.

The idea after all is not to try reinvent the wheel but to train templates...
